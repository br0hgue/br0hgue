# Hello there 
###### general Kenobi, you are a bold one!


I am interested in physics but I also like programming as a hobby.

- Iâ€™m currently learning html, css, js, python and c#
- Fun fact: Everything in the universe is either a potato or not a potato
- I have experience with app programming, chatbots and video game making
- I am in the process of making my first game, Inlusio
- I am working on a visualizer of the Logistic map
